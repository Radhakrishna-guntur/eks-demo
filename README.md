What is EKS

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is AWS’s managed Kubernetes offering. By handling the control plane—API servers, etcd, schedulers, controllers—EKS lets you focus on deploying and operating your containerized workloads. Unlike a self-managed Kubernetes cluster, Amazon EKS splits responsibilities: AWS manages the control plane, while you maintain the data plane in your own AWS account.

Amazon EKS: Simplified Kubernetes Management


Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) provides a fully managed Kubernetes service that eliminates the complexity of operating Kubernetes clusters. With EKS, you can:

Deploy applications faster with less operational overhead

Scale seamlessly to meet changing workload demands

Improve security through AWS integration and automated updates

Choose between standard EKS or fully automated EKS Auto Mode

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is the premiere platform for running Kubernetes clusters, both in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud and in your own data centers (EKS Anywhere and Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes).
Amazon EKS simplifies building, securing, and maintaining Kubernetes clusters. It can be more cost effective at providing enough resources to meet peak demand than maintaining your own data centers.
